Hello! I am a DPhil (PhD) student in the [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/toveygarcia) at the University of Oxford. I work in the [Ice and Fluid Dynamics Group](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/ice-and-fluid-dynamics) under the supervision of Professor [Andrew Wells](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/wellsa) investigating ocean mixing by capsizing (rotating) icebergs.

Hello! I am a DPhil (PhD) student in the [Department of Physics](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/toveygarcia) at the University of Oxford. I work in the [Ice and Fluid Dynamics Group](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/ice-and-fluid-dynamics) under the supervision of Professor [Andrew Wells](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/wellsa) investigating ocean mixing by capsizing (rotating) icebergs. 

I focus particularly on icebergs generated by calving of marine-terminating glaciers into fjords around the peripharies of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Large marine-terminating glacier calving events in Greenland produce kilometer-scale icebergs which rotate as they detach from the glacier front. In doing so, these icebergs are thought to vigorously stir the stratified ocean water in the fjord, like a giant wooden spoon stirring an enormous pot of soup. This modification of fjord water characteristics may impact the flow of the currents that exchange water masses and heat between the glacier and the open ocean, so may influence glacier melt rates. Improving the representation of processes occuring at ice-ocean boundaries in Earth System Models is critical for narrowing down uncertainties in predictions of future sea level rise.

I am working on incorporating capsizing icebergs into ocean models at the iceberg-scale and at the fjord-scale to understand (i) the amount of mixing generated by capsizing icebergs of different shapes and sizes, (ii) the impact of these events on fjord-scale circulation, and (iii) the rate and pattern of glacier melt thus induced.

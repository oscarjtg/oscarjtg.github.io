Abstract: Permittivity  and permeability are essential concepts in physics, as witnessed by their close relationship with fundamental constants such as the speed of light and the fine-structure constant. In much school teaching, permittivity is encountered at a very basic level, but permeability is rarely included. In this paper, some important differences between the two concepts—especially considering their traditional names and some apparent similarities that could lead to misunderstandings—are explained. A case is made that both concepts ought to be included, at least briefly, at higher school level.
